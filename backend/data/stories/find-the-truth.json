      "content": "The door was red and the room was silent. Sarah stood outside, her hand trembling as she reached for the brass handle. The letter had said to come alone, at midnight, to this abandoned warehouse on the edge of the city. She took a deep breath and pushed the door open. Inside, the air was thick with dust and the smell of old wood. A single light bulb hung from the ceiling, casting long shadows across the concrete floor. On the far wall, she noticed a painting of a clock showing 3:17. Underneath i...",

The envelope in her hand felt heavy. She tore it open and found a single sheet of paper with three words written in elegant script: 'Remember the clock.' Sarah looked back at the painting. The clock still showed 3:17, but something was different. She moved closer and noticed that the numbers were actually buttons. She...",

The tunnel seemed to go on forever, but after about fifty steps, she came to another door. This one was different—it was made of metal and had no handle. Instead, there were three symbols carved into its surface: a triangle, a circle, and a square. Sarah remembered the symbol from the door frame—a triangle with a circle inside.
