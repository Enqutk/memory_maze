      "content": "Down the Rabbit-Hole\nAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\nbank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into\nthe book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\nconversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice\n“without pictures or conversations?”\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\nhot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\nmaking a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\npicking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\nclose by her.\nThere was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it\nso _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh\ndear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,\nit occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\ntime it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\nwatch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\non, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\nhad never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\nwatch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\nlarge rabbit-hole under the hedge.\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\nin the world she was to get out again.\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\ndeep well.\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\nplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\nwas going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out\nwhat she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\nlooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\ncupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\nhung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\npassed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great\ndisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\nof killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\ncupboards as she fell past it.\n“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall\nthink nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me\nat home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the\ntop of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)\nDown, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? “I wonder how\nmany miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be\ngetting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would\nbe four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt\nseveral things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\nthough this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\nknowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\npractice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but\nthen I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no\nidea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\ngrand words to say.)\nPresently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right _through_\nthe earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk\nwith their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather\nglad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all\nthe right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the\ncountry is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?”\n(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy _curtseying_ as you’re\nfalling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what\nan ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do\nto ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\ntalking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!”\n(Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at\ntea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are\nno mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s\nvery like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here\nAlice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\ndreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and\nsometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer\neither question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt\nthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\nwalking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\n“Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly,\nthump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\nthe fall was over.\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\nshe looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\nlong passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down\nit. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,\nand was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears\nand whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she\nturned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\nfrom the roof.",

      "content": "The Pool of Tears\n“Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that\nfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); “now I’m\nopening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!”\n(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of\nsight, they were getting so far off). “Oh, my poor little feet, I\nwonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I’m\nsure _I_ shan’t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble\nmyself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be\nkind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk the way I\nwant to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every\nChristmas.”\nAnd she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. “They must\ngo by the carrier,” she thought; “and how funny it’ll seem, sending\npresents to one’s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!\n_Alice’s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with\nAlice’s love_).\nOh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!”\nJust then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was\nnow more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden\nkey and hurried off to the garden door.\nPoor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to\nlook through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more\nhopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.\n“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like\nyou,” (she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way! Stop\nthis moment, I tell you!” But she went on all the same, shedding\ngallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about\nfour inches deep and reaching half down the hall.\nAfter a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and\nshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White\nRabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves\nin one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a\ngreat hurry, muttering to himself as he came, “Oh! the Duchess, the\nDuchess! Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!” Alice felt\nso desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the\nRabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, “If you please,\nsir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and\nthe fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.\nAlice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she\nkept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: “Dear, dear! How\nqueer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.\nI wonder if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the\nsame when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling\na little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who\nin the world am I? Ah, _that’s_ the great puzzle!” And she began\nthinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as\nherself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.\n“I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long\nringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t\nbe Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a\nvery little! Besides, _she’s_ she, and _I’m_ I, and—oh dear, how\npuzzling it all is! I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know.\nLet me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,\nand four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that\nrate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn’t signify: let’s try\nGeography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of\nRome, and Rome—no, _that’s_ all wrong, I’m certain! I must have been\nchanged for Mabel! I’ll try and say ‘_How doth the little_—’” and she\ncrossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began\nto repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words\ndid not come the same as they used to do:—\n“How doth the little crocodile\nImprove his shining tail,\nAnd pour the waters of the Nile\nOn every golden scale!\n“How cheerfully he seems to grin,\nHow neatly spread his claws,\nAnd welcome little fishes in\nWith gently smiling jaws!”\n“I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice, and her eyes\nfilled with tears again as she went on, “I must be Mabel after all, and\nI shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to\nno toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I’ve\nmade up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here! It’ll be\nno use their putting their heads down and saying ‘Come up again, dear!’\nI shall only look up and say ‘Who am I then? Tell me that first, and\nthen, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down\nhere till I’m somebody else’—but, oh dear!” cried Alice, with a sudden\nburst of tears, “I do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so\n_very_ tired of being all alone here!”\nAs she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see\nthat she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while\nshe was talking. “How _can_ I have done that?” she thought. “I must be\ngrowing small again.” She got up and went to the table to measure\nherself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was\nnow about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon\nfound out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she\ndropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.",

      "content": "A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale\nThey were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the\nbirds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close\nto them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.\nThe first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a\nconsultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite\nnatural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if\nshe had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument\nwith the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, “I am\nolder than you, and must know better;” and this Alice would not allow\nwithout knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to\ntell its age, there was no more to be said.\nAt last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,\ncalled out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I’ll_ soon make\nyou dry enough!” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the\nMouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she\nfelt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.\n“Ahem!” said the Mouse with an important air, “are you all ready? This\nis the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! ‘William\nthe Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted\nto by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much\naccustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of\nMercia and Northumbria—’”\n“Ugh!” said the Lory, with a shiver.\n“I beg your pardon!” said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: “Did\nyou speak?”\n“Not I!” said the Lory hastily.\n“I thought you did,” said the Mouse. “—I proceed. ‘Edwin and Morcar,\nthe earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even\nStigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable—’”\n“Found _what_?” said the Duck.\n“Found _it_,” the Mouse replied rather crossly: “of course you know\nwhat ‘it’ means.”\n“I know what ‘it’ means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,” said the\nDuck: “it’s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the\narchbishop find?”\nThe Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, “‘—found\nit advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him\nthe crown. William’s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence\nof his Normans—’ How are you getting on now, my dear?” it continued,\nturning to Alice as it spoke.\n“As wet as ever,” said Alice in a melancholy tone: “it doesn’t seem to\ndry me at all.”\n“In that case,” said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, “I move\nthat the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic\nremedies—”\n“Speak English!” said the Eaglet. “I don’t know the meaning of half\nthose long words, and, what’s more, I don’t believe you do either!” And\nthe Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds\ntittered audibly.\n“What I was going to say,” said the Dodo in an offended tone, “was,\nthat the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.”\n“What _is_ a Caucus-race?” said Alice; not that she wanted much to\nknow, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to\nspeak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.\n“Why,” said the Dodo, “the best way to explain it is to do it.” (And,\nas you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will\ntell you how the Dodo managed it.)\nFirst it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (“the exact\nshape doesn’t matter,” it said,) and then all the party were placed\nalong the course, here and there. There was no “One, two, three, and\naway,” but they began running when they liked, and left off when they\nliked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,\nwhen they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry\nagain, the Dodo suddenly called out “The race is over!” and they all\ncrowded round it, panting, and asking, “But who has won?”\nThis question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of\nthought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its\nforehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the\npictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo\nsaid, “_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.”\n“But who is to give the prizes?” quite a chorus of voices asked.\n“Why, _she_, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one\nfinger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a\nconfused way, “Prizes! Prizes!”\nAlice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her\npocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had\nnot got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly\none a-piece, all round.\n“But she must have a prize herself, you know,” said the Mouse.\n“Of course,” the Dodo replied very gravely. “What else have you got in\nyour pocket?” he went on, turning to Alice.\n“Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly.\n“Hand it over here,” said the Dodo.\nThen they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly\npresented the thimble, saying “We beg your acceptance of this elegant\nthimble;” and, when it had finished this short speech, they all\ncheered.\nAlice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave\nthat she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything\nto say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as\nshe could.\nThe next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and\nconfusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste\ntheirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.\nHowever, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and\nbegged the Mouse to tell them something more.",

      "content": "The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill\nIt was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking\nanxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard\nit muttering to itself “The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh\nmy fur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are\nferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?” Alice guessed in a\nmoment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid\ngloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but\nthey were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since\nher swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the\nlittle door, had vanished completely.\nVery soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and\ncalled out to her in an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you\ndoing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and\na fan! Quick, now!” And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off\nat once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the\nmistake it had made.\n“He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran. “How\nsurprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’d better take him\nhis fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.” As she said this, she\ncame upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass\nplate with the name “W. RABBIT,” engraved upon it. She went in without\nknocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the\nreal Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the\nfan and gloves.\n“How queer it seems,” Alice said to herself, “to be going messages for\na rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!” And she\nbegan fancying the sort of thing that would happen: “‘Miss Alice! Come\nhere directly, and get ready for your walk!’ ‘Coming in a minute,\nnurse! But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.’ Only I\ndon’t think,” Alice went on, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the house\nif it began ordering people about like that!”\nBy this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\nin the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three\npairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the\ngloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a\nlittle bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label\nthis time with the words “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she uncorked it\nand put it to her lips. “I know _something_ interesting is sure to\nhappen,” she said to herself, “whenever I eat or drink anything; so\nI’ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow large\nagain, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!”\nIt did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\ndrunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\nand had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put\ndown the bottle, saying to herself “That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t\ngrow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’t\ndrunk quite so much!”\nAlas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,\nand very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\nwas not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\none elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.\nStill she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\nof the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself “Now I\ncan do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?”\nLuckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,\nand she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there\nseemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\nagain, no wonder she felt unhappy.\n“It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when one wasn’t\nalways growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\nrabbits. I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and\nyet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what\n_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied\nthat kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of\none! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And\nwhen I grow up, I’ll write one—but I’m grown up now,” she added in a\nsorrowful tone; “at least there’s no room to grow up any more _here_.”\n“But then,” thought Alice, “shall I _never_ get any older than I am\nnow? That’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but\nthen—always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn’t like _that!_”\n“Oh, you foolish Alice!” she answered herself. “How can you learn\nlessons in here? Why, there’s hardly room for _you_, and no room at all\nfor any lesson-books!”\nAnd so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and\nmaking quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes\nshe heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\n“Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” said the voice. “Fetch me my gloves this moment!”\nThen came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was\nthe Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the\nhouse, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as\nlarge as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\nPresently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as\nthe door opened inwards, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard against it,\nthat attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself “Then I’ll\ngo round and get in at the window.”",

      "content": "Advice from a Caterpillar\nThe Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in\nsilence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and\naddressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.\n“Who are _you?_” said the Caterpillar.\nThis was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,\nrather shyly, “I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know\nwho I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been\nchanged several times since then.”\n“What do you mean by that?” said the Caterpillar sternly. “Explain\nyourself!”\n“I can’t explain _myself_, I’m afraid, sir,” said Alice, “because I’m\nnot myself, you see.”\n“I don’t see,” said the Caterpillar.\n“I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,” Alice replied very politely,\n“for I can’t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many\ndifferent sizes in a day is very confusing.”\n“It isn’t,” said the Caterpillar.\n“Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,” said Alice; “but when you\nhave to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then\nafter that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little\nqueer, won’t you?”\n“Not a bit,” said the Caterpillar.\n“Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,” said Alice; “all I know\nis, it would feel very queer to _me_.”\n“You!” said the Caterpillar contemptuously. “Who are _you?_”\nWhich brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.\nAlice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar’s making such _very_\nshort remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, “I\nthink, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.”\n“Why?” said the Caterpillar.\nHere was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any\ngood reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant\nstate of mind, she turned away.\n“Come back!” the Caterpillar called after her. “I’ve something\nimportant to say!”\nThis sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.\n“Keep your temper,” said the Caterpillar.\n“Is that all?” said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she\ncould.\n“No,” said the Caterpillar.\nAlice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,\nand perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For\nsome minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded\nits arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, “So you\nthink you’re changed, do you?”\n“I’m afraid I am, sir,” said Alice; “I can’t remember things as I\nused—and I don’t keep the same size for ten minutes together!”\n“Can’t remember _what_ things?” said the Caterpillar.\n“Well, I’ve tried to say “How doth the little busy bee,” but it all\ncame different!” Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.\n“Repeat, ‘_You are old, Father William_,’” said the Caterpillar.\nAlice folded her hands, and began:—\n“You are old, Father William,” the young man said,\n“And your hair has become very white;\nAnd yet you incessantly stand on your head—\nDo you think, at your age, it is right?”\n“In my youth,” Father William replied to his son,\n“I feared it might injure the brain;\nBut, now that I’m perfectly sure I have none,\nWhy, I do it again and again.”\n“You are old,” said the youth, “as I mentioned before,\nAnd have grown most uncommonly fat;\nYet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—\nPray, what is the reason of that?”\n“In my youth,” said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\n“I kept all my limbs very supple\nBy the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—\nAllow me to sell you a couple?”\n“You are old,” said the youth, “and your jaws are too weak\nFor anything tougher than suet;\nYet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—\nPray, how did you manage to do it?”\n“In my youth,” said his father, “I took to the law,\nAnd argued each case with my wife;\nAnd the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\nHas lasted the rest of my life.”\n“You are old,” said the youth, “one would hardly suppose\nThat your eye was as steady as ever;\nYet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—\nWhat made you so awfully clever?”\n“I have answered three questions, and that is enough,”\nSaid his father; “don’t give yourself airs!\nDo you think I can listen all day to such stuff?\nBe off, or I’ll kick you down stairs!”\n“That is not said right,” said the Caterpillar.\n“Not _quite_ right, I’m afraid,” said Alice, timidly; “some of the\nwords have got altered.”\n“It is wrong from beginning to end,” said the Caterpillar decidedly,\nand there was silence for some minutes.\nThe Caterpillar was the first to speak.\n“What size do you want to be?” it asked.\n“Oh, I’m not particular as to size,” Alice hastily replied; “only one\ndoesn’t like changing so often, you know.”\n“I _don’t_ know,” said the Caterpillar.\nAlice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life\nbefore, and she felt that she was losing her temper.\n“Are you content now?” said the Caterpillar.\n“Well, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn’t\nmind,” said Alice: “three inches is such a wretched height to be.”\n“It is a very good height indeed!” said the Caterpillar angrily,\nrearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).\n“But I’m not used to it!” pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she\nthought of herself, “I wish the creatures wouldn’t be so easily\noffended!”\n“You’ll get used to it in time,” said the Caterpillar; and it put the\nhookah into its mouth and began smoking again.",

      "content": "Pig and Pepper\nFor a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what\nto do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the\nwood—(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:\notherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a\nfish)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by\nanother footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\nfrog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled\nall over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all\nabout, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.\nThe Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\nnearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\nsaying, in a solemn tone, “For the Duchess. An invitation from the\nQueen to play croquet.” The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn\ntone, only changing the order of the words a little, “From the Queen.\nAn invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.”\nThen they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\nAlice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood\nfor fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the\nFish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the\ndoor, staring stupidly up into the sky.\nAlice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\n“There’s no sort of use in knocking,” said the Footman, “and that for\ntwo reasons. First, because I’m on the same side of the door as you\nare; secondly, because they’re making such a noise inside, no one could\npossibly hear you.” And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary\nnoise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing, and every now\nand then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to\npieces.\n“Please, then,” said Alice, “how am I to get in?”\n“There might be some sense in your knocking,” the Footman went on\nwithout attending to her, “if we had the door between us. For instance,\nif you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you\nknow.” He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and\nthis Alice thought decidedly uncivil. “But perhaps he can’t help it,”\nshe said to herself; “his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his\nhead. But at any rate he might answer questions.—How am I to get in?”\nshe repeated, aloud.\n“I shall sit here,” the Footman remarked, “till tomorrow—”\nAt this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\nskimming out, straight at the Footman’s head: it just grazed his nose,\nand broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.\n“—or next day, maybe,” the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly\nas if nothing had happened.\n“How am I to get in?” asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\n“_Are_ you to get in at all?” said the Footman. “That’s the first\nquestion, you know.”\nIt was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. “It’s really\ndreadful,” she muttered to herself, “the way all the creatures argue.\nIt’s enough to drive one crazy!”\nThe Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\nremark, with variations. “I shall sit here,” he said, “on and off, for\ndays and days.”\n“But what am _I_ to do?” said Alice.\n“Anything you like,” said the Footman, and began whistling.\n“Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said Alice desperately: “he’s\nperfectly idiotic!” And she opened the door and went in.\nThe door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from\none end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool\nin the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire,\nstirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.\n“There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!” Alice said to\nherself, as well as she could for sneezing.\nThere was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed\noccasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\nalternately without a moment’s pause. The only things in the kitchen\nthat did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting\non the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.\n“Please would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, for she was\nnot quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, “why\nyour cat grins like that?”\n“It’s a Cheshire cat,” said the Duchess, “and that’s why. Pig!”\nShe said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite\njumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the\nbaby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:—\n“I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t\nknow that cats _could_ grin.”\n“They all can,” said the Duchess; “and most of ’em do.”\n“I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said very politely, feeling quite\npleased to have got into a conversation.\n“You don’t know much,” said the Duchess; “and that’s a fact.”\nAlice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would\nbe as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she\nwas trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\nfire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\nthe Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first; then followed a\nshower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of\nthem even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\nthat it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\n“Oh, _please_ mind what you’re doing!” cried Alice, jumping up and down\nin an agony of terror. “Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose!” as an\nunusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it\noff.",

      "content": "A Mad Tea-Party\nThere was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the\nMarch Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting\nbetween them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a\ncushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. “Very\nuncomfortable for the Dormouse,” thought Alice; “only, as it’s asleep,\nI suppose it doesn’t mind.”\nThe table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at\none corner of it: “No room! No room!” they cried out when they saw\nAlice coming. “There’s _plenty_ of room!” said Alice indignantly, and\nshe sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.\n“Have some wine,” the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.\nAlice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.\n“I don’t see any wine,” she remarked.\n“There isn’t any,” said the March Hare.\n“Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,” said Alice angrily.\n“It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,” said\nthe March Hare.\n“I didn’t know it was _your_ table,” said Alice; “it’s laid for a great\nmany more than three.”\n“Your hair wants cutting,” said the Hatter. He had been looking at\nAlice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first\nspeech.\n“You should learn not to make personal remarks,” Alice said with some\nseverity; “it’s very rude.”\nThe Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_\nwas, “Why is a raven like a writing-desk?”\n“Come, we shall have some fun now!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they’ve\nbegun asking riddles.—I believe I can guess that,” she added aloud.\n“Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?” said\nthe March Hare.\n“Exactly so,” said Alice.\n“Then you should say what you mean,” the March Hare went on.\n“I do,” Alice hastily replied; “at least—at least I mean what I\nsay—that’s the same thing, you know.”\n“Not the same thing a bit!” said the Hatter. “You might just as well\nsay that ‘I see what I eat’ is the same thing as ‘I eat what I see’!”\n“You might just as well say,” added the March Hare, “that ‘I like what\nI get’ is the same thing as ‘I get what I like’!”\n“You might just as well say,” added the Dormouse, who seemed to be\ntalking in his sleep, “that ‘I breathe when I sleep’ is the same thing\nas ‘I sleep when I breathe’!”\n“It _is_ the same thing with you,” said the Hatter, and here the\nconversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while\nAlice thought over all she could remember about ravens and\nwriting-desks, which wasn’t much.\nThe Hatter was the first to break the silence. “What day of the month\nis it?” he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his\npocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,\nand holding it to his ear.\nAlice considered a little, and then said “The fourth.”\n“Two days wrong!” sighed the Hatter. “I told you butter wouldn’t suit\nthe works!” he added looking angrily at the March Hare.\n“It was the _best_ butter,” the March Hare meekly replied.\n“Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,” the Hatter grumbled:\n“you shouldn’t have put it in with the bread-knife.”\nThe March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped\nit into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of\nnothing better to say than his first remark, “It was the _best_ butter,\nyou know.”\nAlice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. “What a\nfunny watch!” she remarked. “It tells the day of the month, and doesn’t\ntell what o’clock it is!”\n“Why should it?” muttered the Hatter. “Does _your_ watch tell you what\nyear it is?”\n“Of course not,” Alice replied very readily: “but that’s because it\nstays the same year for such a long time together.”\n“Which is just the case with _mine_,” said the Hatter.\nAlice felt dreadfully puzzled, The Hatter’s remark seemed to have no\nsort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. “I don’t quite\nunderstand you,” she said, as politely as she could.\n“The Dormouse is asleep again,” said the Hatter, and he poured a little\nhot tea upon its nose.\nThe Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its\neyes, “Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.”\n“Have you guessed the riddle yet?” the Hatter said, turning to Alice\nagain.\n“No, I give it up,” Alice replied: “what’s the answer?”\n“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said the Hatter.\n“Nor I,” said the March Hare.\nAlice sighed wearily. “I think you might do something better with the\ntime,” she said, “than waste it in asking riddles that have no\nanswers.”\n“If you knew Time as well as I do,” said the Hatter, “you wouldn’t talk\nabout wasting _it_. It’s _him_.”\n“I don’t know what you mean,” said Alice.\n“Of course you don’t!” the Hatter said, tossing his head\ncontemptuously. “I dare say you never even spoke to Time!”\n“Perhaps not,” Alice cautiously replied: “but I know I have to beat\ntime when I learn music.”\n“Ah! that accounts for it,” said the Hatter. “He won’t stand beating.\nNow, if you only kept on good terms with him, he’d do almost anything\nyou liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o’clock in\nthe morning, just time to begin lessons: you’d only have to whisper a\nhint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,\ntime for dinner!”\n(“I only wish it was,” the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)\n“That would be grand, certainly,” said Alice thoughtfully: “but then—I\nshouldn’t be hungry for it, you know.”",

      "content": "The Queen’s Croquet-Ground\nA large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses\ngrowing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily\npainting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she\nwent nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard\none of them say, “Look out now, Five! Don’t go splashing paint over me\nlike that!”\n“I couldn’t help it,” said Five, in a sulky tone; “Seven jogged my\nelbow.”\nOn which Seven looked up and said, “That’s right, Five! Always lay the\nblame on others!”\n“_You’d_ better not talk!” said Five. “I heard the Queen say only\nyesterday you deserved to be beheaded!”\n“What for?” said the one who had spoken first.\n“That’s none of _your_ business, Two!” said Seven.\n“Yes, it _is_ his business!” said Five, “and I’ll tell him—it was for\nbringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.”\nSeven flung down his brush, and had just begun “Well, of all the unjust\nthings—” when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching\nthem, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also,\nand all of them bowed low.\n“Would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, “why you are\npainting those roses?”\nFive and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low\nvoice, “Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a\n_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen\nwas to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So\nyou see, Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to—” At this\nmoment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called\nout “The Queen! The Queen!” and the three gardeners instantly threw\nthemselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,\nand Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.\nFirst came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the\nthree gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the\ncorners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with\ndiamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came\nthe royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came\njumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all\nornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,\nand among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a\nhurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went\nby without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying\nthe King’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this\ngrand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\nAlice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face\nlike the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard\nof such a rule at processions; “and besides, what would be the use of a\nprocession,” thought she, “if people had all to lie down upon their\nfaces, so that they couldn’t see it?” So she stood still where she was,\nand waited.\nWhen the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked\nat her, and the Queen said severely “Who is this?” She said it to the\nKnave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.\n“Idiot!” said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to\nAlice, she went on, “What’s your name, child?”\n“My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,” said Alice very politely;\nbut she added, to herself, “Why, they’re only a pack of cards, after\nall. I needn’t be afraid of them!”\n“And who are _these?_” said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners\nwho were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on\ntheir faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of\nthe pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,\nor courtiers, or three of her own children.\n“How should _I_ know?” said Alice, surprised at her own courage. “It’s\nno business of _mine_.”\nThe Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a\nmoment like a wild beast, screamed “Off with her head! Off—”\n“Nonsense!” said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was\nsilent.\nThe King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said “Consider, my\ndear: she is only a child!”\nThe Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave “Turn\nthem over!”\nThe Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.\n“Get up!” said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three\ngardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,\nthe royal children, and everybody else.\n“Leave off that!” screamed the Queen. “You make me giddy.” And then,\nturning to the rose-tree, she went on, “What _have_ you been doing\nhere?”\n“May it please your Majesty,” said Two, in a very humble tone, going\ndown on one knee as he spoke, “we were trying—”\n“_I_ see!” said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.\n“Off with their heads!” and the procession moved on, three of the\nsoldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran\nto Alice for protection.\n“You shan’t be beheaded!” said Alice, and she put them into a large\nflower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a\nminute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the\nothers.\n“Are their heads off?” shouted the Queen.\n“Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!” the soldiers shouted\nin reply.\n“That’s right!” shouted the Queen. “Can you play croquet?”\nThe soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was\nevidently meant for her.",

      "content": "The Mock Turtle’s Story\n“You can’t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!”\nsaid the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice’s,\nand they walked off together.\nAlice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought\nto herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so\nsavage when they met in the kitchen.\n“When _I’m_ a Duchess,” she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful\ntone though), “I won’t have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. Soup\ndoes very well without—Maybe it’s always pepper that makes people\nhot-tempered,” she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new\nkind of rule, “and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile that makes\nthem bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things that make children\nsweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn’t be\nso stingy about it, you know—”\nShe had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little\nstartled when she heard her voice close to her ear. “You’re thinking\nabout something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can’t\ntell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in\na bit.”\n“Perhaps it hasn’t one,” Alice ventured to remark.\n“Tut, tut, child!” said the Duchess. “Everything’s got a moral, if only\nyou can find it.” And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice’s side as\nshe spoke.\nAlice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the\nDuchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the\nright height to rest her chin upon Alice’s shoulder, and it was an\nuncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she\nbore it as well as she could.\n“The game’s going on rather better now,” she said, by way of keeping up\nthe conversation a little.\n“’Tis so,” said the Duchess: “and the moral of that is—‘Oh, ’tis love,\n’tis love, that makes the world go round!’”\n“Somebody said,” Alice whispered, “that it’s done by everybody minding\ntheir own business!”\n“Ah, well! It means much the same thing,” said the Duchess, digging her\nsharp little chin into Alice’s shoulder as she added, “and the moral of\n_that_ is—‘Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of\nthemselves.’”\n“How fond she is of finding morals in things!” Alice thought to\nherself.\n“I dare say you’re wondering why I don’t put my arm round your waist,”\nthe Duchess said after a pause: “the reason is, that I’m doubtful about\nthe temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?”\n“He might bite,” Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious\nto have the experiment tried.\n“Very true,” said the Duchess: “flamingoes and mustard both bite. And\nthe moral of that is—‘Birds of a feather flock together.’”\n“Only mustard isn’t a bird,” Alice remarked.\n“Right, as usual,” said the Duchess: “what a clear way you have of\nputting things!”\n“It’s a mineral, I _think_,” said Alice.\n“Of course it is,” said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to\neverything that Alice said; “there’s a large mustard-mine near here.\nAnd the moral of that is—‘The more there is of mine, the less there is\nof yours.’”\n“Oh, I know!” exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last\nremark, “it’s a vegetable. It doesn’t look like one, but it is.”\n“I quite agree with you,” said the Duchess; “and the moral of that\nis—‘Be what you would seem to be’—or if you’d like it put more\nsimply—‘Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might\nappear to others that what you were or might have been was not\notherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be\notherwise.’”\n“I think I should understand that better,” Alice said very politely,\n“if I had it written down: but I can’t quite follow it as you say it.”\n“That’s nothing to what I could say if I chose,” the Duchess replied,\nin a pleased tone.\n“Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,” said\nAlice.\n“Oh, don’t talk about trouble!” said the Duchess. “I make you a present\nof everything I’ve said as yet.”\n“A cheap sort of present!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they don’t give\nbirthday presents like that!” But she did not venture to say it out\nloud.\n“Thinking again?” the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp\nlittle chin.\n“I’ve a right to think,” said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to\nfeel a little worried.\n“Just about as much right,” said the Duchess, “as pigs have to fly; and\nthe m—”\nBut here, to Alice’s great surprise, the Duchess’s voice died away,\neven in the middle of her favourite word ‘moral,’ and the arm that was\nlinked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the\nQueen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a\nthunderstorm.\n“A fine day, your Majesty!” the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.\n“Now, I give you fair warning,” shouted the Queen, stamping on the\nground as she spoke; “either you or your head must be off, and that in\nabout half no time! Take your choice!”\nThe Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.\n“Let’s go on with the game,” the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too\nmuch frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the\ncroquet-ground.\nThe other guests had taken advantage of the Queen’s absence, and were\nresting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried\nback to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment’s delay\nwould cost them their lives.\nAll the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling\nwith the other players, and shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with\nher head!” Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the\nsoldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so\nthat by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and\nall the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody\nand under sentence of execution.",

      "content": "The Lobster Quadrille\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across\nhis eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or\ntwo sobs choked his voice. “Same as if he had a bone in his throat,”\nsaid the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in\nthe back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears\nrunning down his cheeks, he went on again:—\n“You may not have lived much under the sea—” (“I haven’t,” said\nAlice)—“and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster—”\n(Alice began to say “I once tasted—” but checked herself hastily, and\nsaid “No, never”) “—so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a\nLobster Quadrille is!”\n“No, indeed,” said Alice. “What sort of a dance is it?”\n“Why,” said the Gryphon, “you first form into a line along the\nsea-shore—”\n“Two lines!” cried the Mock Turtle. “Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;\nthen, when you’ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—”\n“_That_ generally takes some time,” interrupted the Gryphon.\n“—you advance twice—”\n“Each with a lobster as a partner!” cried the Gryphon.\n“Of course,” the Mock Turtle said: “advance twice, set to partners—”\n“—change lobsters, and retire in same order,” continued the Gryphon.\n“Then, you know,” the Mock Turtle went on, “you throw the—”\n“The lobsters!” shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.\n“—as far out to sea as you can—”\n“Swim after them!” screamed the Gryphon.\n“Turn a somersault in the sea!” cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly\nabout.\n“Change lobsters again!” yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.\n“Back to land again, and that’s all the first figure,” said the Mock\nTurtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had\nbeen jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very\nsadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.\n“It must be a very pretty dance,” said Alice timidly.\n“Would you like to see a little of it?” said the Mock Turtle.\n“Very much indeed,” said Alice.\n“Come, let’s try the first figure!” said the Mock Turtle to the\nGryphon. “We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?”\n“Oh, _you_ sing,” said the Gryphon. “I’ve forgotten the words.”\nSo they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and\nthen treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their\nforepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly\nand sadly:—\n“Will you walk a little faster?” said a whiting to a snail.\n“There’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on my tail.\nSee how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!\nThey are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance?\nWill you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?\nWill you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?\n“You can really have no notion how delightful it will be\nWhen they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!”\nBut the snail replied “Too far, too far!” and gave a look askance—\nSaid he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.\nWould not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.\nWould not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.\n“What matters it how far we go?” his scaly friend replied.\n“There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.\nThe further off from England the nearer is to France—\nThen turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.\nWill you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?\nWill you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?”\n“Thank you, it’s a very interesting dance to watch,” said Alice,\nfeeling very glad that it was over at last: “and I do so like that\ncurious song about the whiting!”\n“Oh, as to the whiting,” said the Mock Turtle, “they—you’ve seen them,\nof course?”\n“Yes,” said Alice, “I’ve often seen them at dinn—” she checked herself\nhastily.\n“I don’t know where Dinn may be,” said the Mock Turtle, “but if you’ve\nseen them so often, of course you know what they’re like.”\n“I believe so,” Alice replied thoughtfully. “They have their tails in\ntheir mouths—and they’re all over crumbs.”\n“You’re wrong about the crumbs,” said the Mock Turtle: “crumbs would\nall wash off in the sea. But they _have_ their tails in their mouths;\nand the reason is—” here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his\neyes.—“Tell her about the reason and all that,” he said to the Gryphon.\n“The reason is,” said the Gryphon, “that they _would_ go with the\nlobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to\nfall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they\ncouldn’t get them out again. That’s all.”\n“Thank you,” said Alice, “it’s very interesting. I never knew so much\nabout a whiting before.”\n“I can tell you more than that, if you like,” said the Gryphon. “Do you\nknow why it’s called a whiting?”\n“I never thought about it,” said Alice. “Why?”\n“_It does the boots and shoes_,” the Gryphon replied very solemnly.\nAlice was thoroughly puzzled. “Does the boots and shoes!” she repeated\nin a wondering tone.\n“Why, what are _your_ shoes done with?” said the Gryphon. “I mean, what\nmakes them so shiny?”\nAlice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her\nanswer. “They’re done with blacking, I believe.”\n“Boots and shoes under the sea,” the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,\n“are done with a whiting. Now you know.”\n“And what are they made of?” Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.",
