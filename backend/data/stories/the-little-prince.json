The pilot, who had given up drawing as a child after adults criticized his drawings, draws several sheep, but the prince rejects them all. Finally, the pilot draws a box and tells the prince that the sheep is inside. The prince is delighted. The prince tells the pilot that he comes from a very small planet, Asteroid B-612. He says that his planet is so small that he can watch the sunset forty-four times in one day by simply moving his chair.",
