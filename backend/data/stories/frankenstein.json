      "content": "I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most\ndistinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years\ncounsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public\nsituations with honour and reputation. He was respected by all who\nknew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public\nbusiness. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the\naffairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his\nmarrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a\nhusband and the father of a family.\nAs the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot\nrefrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a\nmerchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous\nmischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a\nproud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty\nand oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been\ndistinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts,\ntherefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his\ndaughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in\nwretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and\nwas deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.\nHe bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct\nso little worthy of the affection that united them. He lost no time in\nendeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin\nthe world again through his credit and assistance.\nBeaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten\nmonths before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery,\nhe hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the\nReuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort\nhad saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but\nit was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in\nthe meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a\nmerchant’s house. The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction;\nhis grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for\nreflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end\nof three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.\nHis daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw\nwith despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that\nthere was no other prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort\npossessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support\nher in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw and\nby various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to\nsupport life.\nSeveral months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time\nwas more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence\ndecreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving\nher an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her, and she knelt\nby Beaufort’s coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the\nchamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who\ncommitted herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he\nconducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a\nrelation. Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.\nThere was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but\nthis circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted\naffection. There was a sense of justice in my father’s upright mind\nwhich rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love\nstrongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the\nlate-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set\na greater value on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and\nworship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the\ndoting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her\nvirtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing\nher for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace\nto his behaviour to her. Everything was made to yield to her wishes\nand her convenience. He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is\nsheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her\nwith all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and\nbenevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto\nconstant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. During\nthe two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had\ngradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after\ntheir union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change\nof scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders,\nas a restorative for her weakened frame.\nFrom Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born\nat Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained\nfor several years their only child. Much as they were attached to each\nother, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very\nmine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother’s tender caresses and\nmy father’s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my\nfirst recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something\nbetter—their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on\nthem by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in\ntheir hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled\ntheir duties towards me. With this deep consciousness of what they owed\ntowards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit\nof tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during\nevery hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity,\nand of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but\none train of enjoyment to me.",

      "content": "We were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in\nour ages. I need not say that we were strangers to any species of\ndisunion or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and\nthe diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us\nnearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated\ndisposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense\napplication and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge.\nShe busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets;\nand in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss\nhome —the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons,\ntempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of\nour Alpine summers—she found ample scope for admiration and delight.\nWhile my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the\nmagnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their\ncauses. The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine.\nCuriosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature,\ngladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the\nearliest sensations I can remember.\nOn the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave\nup entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native\ncountry. We possessed a house in Geneva, and a _campagne_ on Belrive,\nthe eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a\nleague from the city. We resided principally in the latter, and the\nlives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion. It was my\ntemper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few. I was\nindifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I united\nmyself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. Henry\nClerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular\ntalent and fancy. He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for\nits own sake. He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance. He\ncomposed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and\nknightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays and to enter into\nmasquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of\nRoncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous\ntrain who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands\nof the infidels.\nNo human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My\nparents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence.\nWe felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to\ntheir caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights\nwhich we enjoyed. When I mingled with other families I distinctly\ndiscerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted\nthe development of filial love.\nMy temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some\nlaw in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits\nbut to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things\nindiscriminately. I confess that neither the structure of languages,\nnor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states\npossessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and earth\nthat I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of\nthings or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man\nthat occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical,\nor in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.\nMeanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral\nrelations of things. The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes,\nand the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream was\nto become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the\ngallant and adventurous benefactors of our species. The saintly soul\nof Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home.\nHer sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of\nher celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. She was\nthe living spirit of love to soften and attract; I might have become\nsullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that\nshe was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness. And\nClerval—could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval? Yet\nhe might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his\ngenerosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for\nadventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of\nbeneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring\nambition.\nI feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood,\nbefore misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of\nextensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self. Besides,\nin drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those events which\nled, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when I would\naccount to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my\ndestiny I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost\nforgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent\nwhich, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.\nNatural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire,\ntherefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my\npredilection for that science. When I was thirteen years of age we all went\non a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon; the inclemency of the\nweather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In this house I\nchanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa. I opened it\nwith apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful\nfacts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm. A new\nlight seemed to dawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, I communicated my\ndiscovery to my father. My father looked carelessly at the title page of my\nbook and said, “Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! My dear Victor, do not waste\nyour time upon this; it is sad trash.”",

      "content": "When I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that I\nshould become a student at the university of Ingolstadt. I had\nhitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it\nnecessary for the completion of my education that I should be made\nacquainted with other customs than those of my native country. My\ndeparture was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day\nresolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life\noccurred—an omen, as it were, of my future misery.\nElizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was\nin the greatest danger. During her illness many arguments had been urged to\npersuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. She had at first\nyielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her\nfavourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. She\nattended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity\nof the distemper—Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this\nimprudence were fatal to her preserver. On the third day my mother\nsickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the\nlooks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event. On her\ndeathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert\nher. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself. “My\nchildren,” she said, “my firmest hopes of future happiness were\nplaced on the prospect of your union. This expectation will now be the\nconsolation of your father. Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to\nmy younger children. Alas! I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy\nand beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all? But these are\nnot thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to\ndeath and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.”\nShe died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death.\nI need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent\nby that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the\nsoul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance. It is so\nlong before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day\nand whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed\nfor ever—that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been\nextinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear\ncan be hushed, never more to be heard. These are the reflections of\nthe first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the\nevil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences. Yet from whom has\nnot that rude hand rent away some dear connection? And why should I\ndescribe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel? The time at\nlength arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and\nthe smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a\nsacrilege, is not banished. My mother was dead, but we had still\nduties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with the\nrest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the\nspoiler has not seized.\nMy departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events,\nwas now again determined upon. I obtained from my father a respite of\nsome weeks. It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose,\nakin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of\nlife. I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me. I was\nunwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me, and above\nall, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled.\nShe indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all.\nShe looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and\nzeal. She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call\nher uncle and cousins. Never was she so enchanting as at this time,\nwhen she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us.\nShe forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.\nThe day of my departure at length arrived. Clerval spent the last\nevening with us. He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit\nhim to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain. His\nfather was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the\naspirations and ambition of his son. Henry deeply felt the misfortune\nof being debarred from a liberal education. He said little, but when\nhe spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a\nrestrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details\nof commerce.\nWe sat late. We could not tear ourselves away from each other nor\npersuade ourselves to say the word “Farewell!” It was said, and we\nretired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the\nother was deceived; but when at morning’s dawn I descended to the\ncarriage which was to convey me away, they were all there—my father\nagain to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to\nrenew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the last\nfeminine attentions on her playmate and friend.\nI threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in\nthe most melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded by\namiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual\npleasure—I was now alone. In the university whither I was going I\nmust form my own friends and be my own protector. My life had hitherto\nbeen remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible\nrepugnance to new countenances. I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and\nClerval; these were “old familiar faces,” but I believed myself\ntotally unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my reflections as\nI commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. I\nardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at home,\nthought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had\nlonged to enter the world and take my station among other human beings. \nNow my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to\nrepent.",

      "chapter": 4,
      "title": "Chapter 4",
      "content": "From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the\nmost comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation.\nI read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination,\nwhich modern inquirers have written on these subjects. I attended the\nlectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the\nuniversity, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense\nand real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive\nphysiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable. In\nM. Waldman I found a true friend. His gentleness was never tinged by\ndogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and\ngood nature that banished every idea of pedantry. In a thousand ways\nhe smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse\ninquiries clear and facile to my apprehension. My application was at\nfirst fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and\nsoon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the\nlight of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.\nAs I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress\nwas rapid. My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and\nmy proficiency that of the masters. Professor Krempe often asked me,\nwith a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman\nexpressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress. Two years\npassed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was\nengaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I\nhoped to make. None but those who have experienced them can conceive\nof the enticements of science. In other studies you go as far as\nothers have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in\na scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.\nA mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must\ninfallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who\ncontinually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was\nsolely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two\nyears I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical\ninstruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the\nuniversity. When I had arrived at this point and had become as well\nacquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as\ndepended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my\nresidence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought\nof returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident\nhappened that protracted my stay.\nOne of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was\nthe structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with\nlife. Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?\nIt was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a\nmystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming\nacquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our\ninquiries. I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined\nthenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of\nnatural philosophy which relate to physiology. Unless I had been\nanimated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this\nstudy would have been irksome and almost intolerable. To examine the\ncauses of life, we must first have recourse to death. I became\nacquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I\nmust also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.\nIn my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my\nmind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not ever\nremember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared\nthe apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and\na churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of\nlife, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become\nfood for the worm. Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of\nthis decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and\ncharnel-houses. My attention was fixed upon every object the most\ninsupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw how the\nfine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of\ndeath succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm\ninherited the wonders of the eye and brain. I paused, examining and\nanalysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change\nfrom life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this\ndarkness a sudden light broke in upon me—a light so brilliant and\nwondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity\nof the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so\nmany men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same\nscience, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a\nsecret.\nRemember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun does not\nmore certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is\ntrue. Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the\ndiscovery were distinct and probable. After days and nights of\nincredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of\ngeneration and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing\nanimation upon lifeless matter.\nThe astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery\nsoon gave place to delight and rapture. After so much time spent in\npainful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the\nmost gratifying consummation of my toils. But this discovery was so\ngreat and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been\nprogressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result.\nWhat had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation\nof the world was now within my grasp. Not that, like a magic scene, it\nall opened upon me at once: the information I had obtained was of a\nnature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them\ntowards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already\naccomplished. I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead\nand found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly\nineffectual light.",

      "content": "It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment\nof my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I\ncollected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a\nspark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was\nalready one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the\npanes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the\nhalf-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature\nopen; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.\nHow can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate\nthe wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to\nform? His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as\nbeautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered\nthe work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous\nblack, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these\nluxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes,\nthat seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which\nthey were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.\nThe different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings\nof human nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole\npurpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had\ndeprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour\nthat far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty\nof the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my\nheart. Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I\nrushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my\nbed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep. At length lassitude\nsucceeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the\nbed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.\nBut it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest\ndreams. I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in\nthe streets of Ingolstadt. Delighted and surprised, I embraced her,\nbut as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with\nthe hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I\nheld the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her\nform, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.\nI started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my\nteeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and\nyellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window\nshutters, I beheld the wretch—the miserable monster whom I had\ncreated. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they\nmay be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some\ninarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have\nspoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to\ndetain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs. I took refuge in the\ncourtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained\nduring the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest\nagitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if\nit were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I\nhad so miserably given life.\nOh! No mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy\nagain endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. I\nhad gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those\nmuscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing\nsuch as even Dante could not have conceived.\nI passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and\nhardly that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly\nsank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness. Mingled with\nthis horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had\nbeen my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a\nhell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!\nMorning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my\nsleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple\nand clock, which indicated the sixth hour. The porter opened the gates\nof the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into\nthe streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the\nwretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my\nview. I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but\nfelt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured\nfrom a black and comfortless sky.\nI continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by\nbodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I\ntraversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or\nwhat I was doing. My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and I\nhurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me:\nLike one who, on a lonely road,\nDoth walk in fear and dread,\nAnd, having once turned round, walks on,\nAnd turns no more his head;\nBecause he knows a frightful fiend\nDoth close behind him tread.\n[Coleridge’s “Ancient Mariner.”]\nContinuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various\ndiligences and carriages usually stopped. Here I paused, I knew not why;\nbut I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming\ntowards me from the other end of the street. As it drew nearer I observed\nthat it was the Swiss diligence; it stopped just where I was standing, and\non the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me,\ninstantly sprung out. “My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed he,\n“how glad I am to see you! How fortunate that you should be here at\nthe very moment of my alighting!”",

      "content": "Clerval then put the following letter into my hands. It was from my\nown Elizabeth:\n“My dearest Cousin,\n“You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear\nkind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account. You are\nforbidden to write—to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor,\nis necessary to calm our apprehensions. For a long time I have thought\nthat each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have\nrestrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt. I have\nprevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so\nlong a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being able to\nperform it myself! I figure to myself that the task of attending on\nyour sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never\nguess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of\nyour poor cousin. Yet that is over now: Clerval writes that indeed\nyou are getting better. I eagerly hope that you will confirm this\nintelligence soon in your own handwriting.\n“Get well—and return to us. You will find a happy, cheerful home and\nfriends who love you dearly. Your father’s health is vigorous, and he\nasks but to see you, but to be assured that you are well; and not a\ncare will ever cloud his benevolent countenance. How pleased you would\nbe to remark the improvement of our Ernest! He is now sixteen and full\nof activity and spirit. He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enter\ninto foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his\nelder brother returns to us. My uncle is not pleased with the idea of\na military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had your\npowers of application. He looks upon study as an odious fetter; his\ntime is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the\nlake. I fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point\nand permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.\n“Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken\nplace since you left us. The blue lake and snow-clad mountains—they\nnever change; and I think our placid home and our contented hearts are\nregulated by the same immutable laws. My trifling occupations take up\nmy time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing\nnone but happy, kind faces around me. Since you left us, but one\nchange has taken place in our little household. Do you remember on\nwhat occasion Justine Moritz entered our family? Probably you do not;\nI will relate her history, therefore in a few words. Madame Moritz,\nher mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the\nthird. This girl had always been the favourite of her father, but\nthrough a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and\nafter the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill. My aunt observed\nthis, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother\nto allow her to live at our house. The republican institutions of our\ncountry have produced simpler and happier manners than those which\nprevail in the great monarchies that surround it. Hence there is less\ndistinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the\nlower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are\nmore refined and moral. A servant in Geneva does not mean the same\nthing as a servant in France and England. Justine, thus received in\nour family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our\nfortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a\nsacrifice of the dignity of a human being.\n“Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I\nrecollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one\nglance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that\nAriosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica—she looked so\nfrank-hearted and happy. My aunt conceived a great attachment for her,\nby which she was induced to give her an education superior to that\nwhich she had at first intended. This benefit was fully repaid;\nJustine was the most grateful little creature in the world: I do not\nmean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but\nyou could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.\nAlthough her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate,\nyet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt. She\nthought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her\nphraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.\n“When my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own\ngrief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness\nwith the most anxious affection. Poor Justine was very ill; but other\ntrials were reserved for her.\n“One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the\nexception of her neglected daughter, was left childless. The\nconscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the\ndeaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her\npartiality. She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor\nconfirmed the idea which she had conceived. Accordingly, a few months\nafter your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her\nrepentant mother. Poor girl! She wept when she quitted our house; she\nwas much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness\nand a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable\nfor vivacity. Nor was her residence at her mother’s house of a nature\nto restore her gaiety. The poor woman was very vacillating in her\nrepentance. She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness,\nbut much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her\nbrothers and sister. Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz\ninto a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is\nnow at peace for ever. She died on the first approach of cold weather,\nat the beginning of this last winter. Justine has just returned to us;\nand I assure you I love her tenderly. She is very clever and gentle,\nand extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her\nexpression continually remind me of my dear aunt.",

      "content": "On my return, I found the following letter from my father:—\n“My dear Victor,\n“You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of\nyour return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few\nlines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you. But\nthat would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it. What would be\nyour surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to\nbehold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness? And how, Victor, can\nI relate our misfortune? Absence cannot have rendered you callous to\nour joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent\nson? I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is\nimpossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words\nwhich are to convey to you the horrible tidings.\n“William is dead!—that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed\nmy heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay! Victor, he is murdered!\n“I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the\ncircumstances of the transaction.\n“Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to\nwalk in Plainpalais. The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged\nour walk farther than usual. It was already dusk before we thought of\nreturning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone\non before, were not to be found. We accordingly rested on a seat until\nthey should return. Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen\nhis brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that William\nhad run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and\nafterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return.\n“This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him\nuntil night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have\nreturned to the house. He was not there. We returned again, with\ntorches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had\nlost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night;\nElizabeth also suffered extreme anguish. About five in the morning I\ndiscovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and\nactive in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the\nprint of the murder’s finger was on his neck.\n“He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my\ncountenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth. She was very earnest to\nsee the corpse. At first I attempted to prevent her but she persisted,\nand entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the\nvictim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, ‘O God! I have murdered my\ndarling child!’\n“She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she again\nlived, it was only to weep and sigh. She told me, that that same\nevening William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable\nminiature that she possessed of your mother. This picture is gone, and\nwas doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed. We\nhave no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him\nare unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved William!\n“Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth. She weeps\ncontinually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death;\nher words pierce my heart. We are all unhappy; but will not that be an\nadditional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter?\nYour dear mother! Alas, Victor! I now say, Thank God she did not live\nto witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!\n“Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin,\nbut with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of\nfestering, the wounds of our minds. Enter the house of mourning, my\nfriend, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not\nwith hatred for your enemies.\n“Your affectionate and afflicted father,\n“Alphonse Frankenstein.\n“Geneva, May 12th, 17—.”\nClerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was\nsurprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy I at first\nexpressed on receiving news from my friends. I threw the letter on the\ntable, and covered my face with my hands.\n“My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me\nweep with bitterness, “are you always to be unhappy? My dear friend,\nwhat has happened?”\nI motioned him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the\nroom in the extremest agitation. Tears also gushed from the eyes of\nClerval, as he read the account of my misfortune.\n“I can offer you no consolation, my friend,” said he;\n“your disaster is irreparable. What do you intend to do?”\n“To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.”\nDuring our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation;\nhe could only express his heartfelt sympathy. “Poor William!” said he,\n“dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother! Who that had\nseen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his\nuntimely loss! To die so miserably; to feel the murderer’s grasp! How\nmuch more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence! Poor little\nfellow! one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but\nhe is at rest. The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ever.\nA sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain. He can no longer\nbe a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable\nsurvivors.”\nClerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words\nimpressed themselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwards in\nsolitude. But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a\ncabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend.",

      "chapter": 8,
      "title": "Chapter 8",
      "content": "We passed a few sad hours until eleven o’clock, when the trial was to\ncommence. My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend\nas witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of\nthis wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture. It was to\nbe decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would\ncause the death of two of my fellow beings: one a smiling babe full of\ninnocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every\naggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.\nJustine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised\nto render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an\nignominious grave, and I the cause! A thousand times rather would I\nhave confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I\nwas absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have\nbeen considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have\nexculpated her who suffered through me.\nThe appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning, and\nher countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her\nfeelings, exquisitely beautiful. Yet she appeared confident in\ninnocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by\nthousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have\nexcited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the\nimagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. She\nwas tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as\nher confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she\nworked up her mind to an appearance of courage. When she entered the\ncourt she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were\nseated. A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly\nrecovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest\nher utter guiltlessness.\nThe trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the\ncharge, several witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined\nagainst her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof\nof her innocence as I had. She had been out the whole of the night on\nwhich the murder had been committed and towards morning had been\nperceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the\nmurdered child had been afterwards found. The woman asked her what she\ndid there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused\nand unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about eight\no’clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she\nreplied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly\nif anything had been heard concerning him. When shown the body, she\nfell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days. The\npicture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket;\nand when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same\nwhich, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round\nhis neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.\nJustine was called on for her defence. As the trial had proceeded, her\ncountenance had altered. Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly\nexpressed. Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was\ndesired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible\nalthough variable voice.\n“God knows,” she said, “how entirely I am innocent. But I\ndo not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my innocence\non a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced\nagainst me, and I hope the character I have always borne will incline my\njudges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears\ndoubtful or suspicious.”\nShe then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed\nthe evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the\nhouse of an aunt at Chêne, a village situated at about a league from\nGeneva. On her return, at about nine o’clock, she met a man who asked\nher if she had seen anything of the child who was lost. She was\nalarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him,\nwhen the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain\nseveral hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being\nunwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known. Most\nof the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that\nshe slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke.\nIt was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour\nto find my brother. If she had gone near the spot where his body lay,\nit was without her knowledge. That she had been bewildered when\nquestioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed\na sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain.\nConcerning the picture she could give no account.\n“I know,” continued the unhappy victim, “how heavily and\nfatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of\nexplaining it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left\nto conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been\nplaced in my pocket. But here also I am checked. I believe that I have no\nenemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me\nwantonly. Did the murderer place it there? I know of no opportunity\nafforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen the\njewel, to part with it again so soon?",

      "chapter": 9,
      "title": "Chapter 9",
      "content": "Nothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have\nbeen worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of\ninaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope\nand fear. Justine died, she rested, and I was alive. The blood flowed\nfreely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my\nheart which nothing could remove. Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered\nlike an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond\ndescription horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded myself) was yet\nbehind. Yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue.\nI had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment\nwhen I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow\nbeings. Now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience\nwhich allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and\nfrom thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and\nthe sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures\nsuch as no language can describe.\nThis state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps never\nentirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained. I shunned\nthe face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me;\nsolitude was my only consolation—deep, dark, deathlike solitude.\nMy father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition\nand habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his\nserene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and\nawaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me.\n“Do you think, Victor,” said he, “that I do not suffer\nalso? No one could love a child more than I loved your\nbrother”—tears came into his eyes as he spoke—“but\nis it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting\ntheir unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief? It is also a duty\nowed to yourself, for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment,\nor even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for\nsociety.”\nThis advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I\nshould have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if\nremorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my\nother sensations. Now I could only answer my father with a look of\ndespair and endeavour to hide myself from his view.\nAbout this time we retired to our house at Belrive. This change was\nparticularly agreeable to me. The shutting of the gates regularly at\nten o’clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that\nhour had rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome\nto me. I was now free. Often, after the rest of the family had\nretired for the night, I took the boat and passed many hours upon the\nwater. Sometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the wind; and\nsometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat to\npursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections. I\nwas often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only\nunquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and\nheavenly—if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and\ninterrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore—often,\nI say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters\nmight close over me and my calamities for ever. But I was restrained,\nwhen I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly\nloved, and whose existence was bound up in mine. I thought also of my\nfather and surviving brother; should I by my base desertion leave them\nexposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose\namong them?\nAt these moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my\nmind only that I might afford them consolation and happiness. But that\ncould not be. Remorse extinguished every hope. I had been the author of\nunalterable evils, and I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I had\ncreated should perpetrate some new wickedness. I had an obscure feeling\nthat all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime,\nwhich by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past.\nThere was always scope for fear so long as anything I loved remained\nbehind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived. When I thought of\nhim I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished to\nextinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed. When I\nreflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds\nof moderation. I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the\nAndes, could I, when there, have precipitated him to their base. I wished\nto see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his\nhead and avenge the deaths of William and Justine.\nOur house was the house of mourning. My father’s health was deeply\nshaken by the horror of the recent events. Elizabeth was sad and\ndesponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all\npleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she\nthen thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted\nand destroyed. She was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth\nwandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our\nfuture prospects. The first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from\nthe earth had visited her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearest\nsmiles.",

      "chapter": 10,
      "title": "Chapter 10",
      "content": "I spent the following day roaming through the valley. I stood beside\nthe sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that\nwith slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to\nbarricade the valley. The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before\nme; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were\nscattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious\npresence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by the brawling\nwaves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the\navalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the\naccumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws,\nwas ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in\ntheir hands. These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the\ngreatest consolation that I was capable of receiving. They elevated me\nfrom all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my\ngrief, they subdued and tranquillised it. In some degree, also, they\ndiverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the\nlast month. I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were,\nwaited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I\nhad contemplated during the day. They congregated round me; the\nunstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods,\nand ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds—they all\ngathered round me and bade me be at peace.\nWhere had they fled when the next morning I awoke? All of\nsoul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every\nthought. The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the\nsummits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those\nmighty friends. Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek them\nin their cloudy retreats. What were rain and storm to me? My mule was\nbrought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of\nMontanvert. I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous\nand ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it.\nIt had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the\nsoul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.\nThe sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the\neffect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing\ncares of life. I determined to go without a guide, for I was well\nacquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the\nsolitary grandeur of the scene.\nThe ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short\nwindings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the\nmountain. It is a scene terrifically desolate. In a thousand spots\nthe traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie\nbroken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent,\nleaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon\nother trees. The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines\nof snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is\nparticularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking\nin a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw\ndestruction upon the head of the speaker. The pines are not tall or\nluxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene.\nI looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers\nwhich ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite\nmountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain\npoured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I\nreceived from the objects around me. Alas! Why does man boast of\nsensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders\nthem more necessary beings. If our impulses were confined to hunger,\nthirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by\nevery wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may\nconvey to us.\nWe rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.\nWe rise; one wand’ring thought pollutes the day.\nWe feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,\nEmbrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;\nIt is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow,\nThe path of its departure still is free.\nMan’s yesterday may ne’er be like his morrow;\nNought may endure but mutability!\nIt was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent. For some\ntime I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist covered\nboth that and the surrounding mountains. Presently a breeze dissipated\nthe cloud, and I descended upon the glacier. The surface is very\nuneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and\ninterspersed by rifts that sink deep. The field of ice is almost a\nleague in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it. The\nopposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. From the side where I\nnow stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league;\nand above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty. I remained in a recess\nof the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene. The sea,\nor rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains,\nwhose aerial summits hung over its recesses. Their icy and glittering\npeaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds. My heart, which was\nbefore sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed,\n“Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow\nbeds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion,\naway from the joys of life.”",
